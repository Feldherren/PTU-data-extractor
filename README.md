# PTU-data-extractor
Python scripts for extracting data from PTU books.

Currently only deals with the Pokedex book, and has issues with certain odd characters showing up at spots. Data is formatted for use with another application of mine; PTU-trainer-generator, also on github. But it's probably easier to convert to whatever format you want than the PDF itself.

####Things it is currently getting wrong (probably some dumb encoding issue, but as of currently I still haven't solved it)

Swi╦Ø should be Swift (Ability: Swift Swim)

De╦Üant should be Defiant (Ability: Defiant)

Re╦åect should be Reflect

Con╦Üdence should be Confidence (Ability: Confidence)

In╦Ültrator should be Infiltrator (Ability: Infiltrator)

Flu╦øy should be Fluffy (Ability: Fluffy Charge)

Justi╦Üed should be Justified (Ability: Justified)

Gi╦Ø should be Gift (Ability: Flower Gift)

E╦øect should be Effect (Ability: Effect Spore)

Con╦Øned should be Confined; as this shows up in Hoopa's name, this means Hoopa is not correctly identified as a legendary pokemon.

Tornadus, Thundurus and Landorus Therian Forme all show up as ╦£Erian Forme; similar to Confined Hoopa, they aren't correctly identified as legendary pokemon. 

Generally doesn't like lower-case Fs. Or F-sounds, even. Most of the issues seem to contain the ╦ character, though, so they should be easy to find.

####Other notes (1.05 Plus)

Empoleon has 'Omnivore' misspelled as 'Ominvore', and has a period following it, unlike most Diet sections.

Pancham and a few others have 'Human-Like', instead of 'Humanshape' I assume, for an egg-group.

Earlier Pokemon with no gender have 'No Gender' in Gender Ratio. More-recent legendaries have 'Genderless' instead, but I think they're supposed to be the same.

Meloetta Aria/Step 'Form', rather than Forme.

Meloetta Step Forme has the Advanced Ability 'Spining Dance'; should be 'Spinning Dance'.
