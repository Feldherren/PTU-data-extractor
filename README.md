# PTU-data-extractor
Python scripts for extracting data from PTU books.

Currently only deals with the Pokedex book, and has issues with certain odd characters showing up at spots. Data is formatted for use with another application of mine; PTU-trainer-generator, also on github. But it's probably easier to convert to whatever format you want than the PDF itself.
